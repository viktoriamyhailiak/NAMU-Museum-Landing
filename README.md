The NAMU Museum landing page features a clean and intuitive design that facilitates easy ticket purchasing for museum events. To enhance user engagement, a swiper component is integrated, allowing users to seamlessly browse through event images, exhibitions, or key highlights of the museum. This interactive element adds a dynamic touch to the page, making it more engaging and visually appealing.

CSS Grid is extensively used in the layout to create a responsive and organized structure, ensuring that all elements are arranged neatly, whether on desktop or mobile devices. The combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox offers flexibility, allowing content such as event details, images, and ticket options to be arranged in an easy-to-read and balanced format.

Various CSS features, including hover effects and smooth transitions, further enhance the user experience, providing an interactive feel throughout the page. The swiper component, along with custom animations and well-structured grid design, ensures that the NAMU Museum landing page is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, guiding users effortlessly through the ticket purchasing process.
